      Vanilla JavaScript application logic including:
      - Dummy product data
      - In-memory cart system with add/remove/update
      - Hash-based router (#home, #products, #cart, etc.)
      - Dynamic view rendering (Home, Products, Cart, Auth)
      - Event delegation for navigation and cart actions
      - DOM-based templating (no framework)

features:
  - Single Page Application (SPA) behavior on index.html
  - Client-side routing using window.location.hash
  - Persistent cart state (in memory – resets on refresh)
  - Fully responsive design (mobile to desktop)
  - Modern glassmorphism + gradient aesthetic
  - Accessible markup with aria-live regions
  - No build tools required – pure HTML/CSS/JS
  - Demo auth pages (login/signup) with fake submission alerts

routes:
  "/index.html": Home (default)
  "/index.html#home": Home view (currently empty – ready for hero content)
  "/index.html#products": Products grid with "Add to Cart" buttons
  "/index.html#cart": Cart summary with remove items functionality
  "/login.html": Login demo page
  "/signup.html": Signup demo page

deployment:
  type: static
  platforms:
    - Netlify
    - Vercel
    - GitHub Pages
    - Cloudflare Pages
    - Any web server
  build_command: none        # Zero-config deployment

notes: |
  - This is a prototype/demo – no backend, no persistence, no real payments.
  - Cart data is stored only in memory (resets on page refresh).
  - Auth forms show alerts – no data is sent or stored.
  - Easily extensible: add real API calls, localStorage persistence, or convert to React/Vue.
